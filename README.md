# Competitive Programming

This is a repository of all my problems that I am solving during my competitive programming career. Here are problems from various competitions and problemsets such as CodeForces (codeforces.com), TopCoder (topcoder.com), CSES (cses.fi) and so on.

The solutions are mainly in C++ although I am trying experimenting with other languages as well, such as C#, Rust, Java, Python and Kotlin.
